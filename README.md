### User Stories

**User Story #1**: I can see a textarea element with a corresponding id="editor".

**User Story #2**: I can see an element with a corresponding id="preview".

**User Story #3**: When I enter text into the #editor element, the #preview element is updated as I type to display the content of the textarea.

**User Story #4**: When I enter GitHub flavored markdown into the #editor element, the text is rendered as HTML in the #preview element as I type (HINT: You don't need to parse Markdown yourself - you can import the Marked library for this: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/marked).

**User Story #5**: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header (H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, an image, and bolded text.

**User Story #6**: When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as HTML in the #preview element.
